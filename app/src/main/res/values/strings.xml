        "My idea was building an application in android interface. This application will track down the registered bus and show it’s current location in user’s map. It also shows the distance between the user and the bus.
it will help us to manage our time to get a bus as it shows the bus current location so we do not have to wait for bus at the bus stop for an unknown time. As my idea was about an android mobile application so it is very flexible for everyone to use this application during travel.\n\n"
